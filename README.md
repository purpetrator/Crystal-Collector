# JQuery Game

> Deployed: https://purpetrator.github.io/Crystal-Collector/

For this project I created a "Crystal Collector" game using JQuery.

The goal of the game is to match the computer's randomly generated number without going over.

Each of the four crystals is assigned a random concealed value at the start of the game. The player clicks a crystal to increase his total score. Each crystal click results in a cumulative increase of your score. The player wins by matching the computer's random number.
